            Cookies are tiny text files that live in your browser. They help websites remember things about youâ€”like keeping you logged in. Think of them as little sticky notes your browser uses to help you out.

            <li><strong>Staying logged in:</strong> We use cookies to remember who you are after you sign in, so you don't have to log in every time you visit.</li>

            <li><strong>Understanding how our service is used:</strong> We use cookies to collect analytics about how people use our site (like which links are clicked or how many people view a profile). This helps us improve our service. All analytics data is stored and processed by us, and is <strong>not shared with third parties</strong>.</li>
